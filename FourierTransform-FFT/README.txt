Well, there are countless fair warnings worth mentioning.
First, My code runs on a slightly altered version of Manim.
  resultantly, it won't run on an unaltered verson. I have the code posted anyways
  for the sake of reference.
Second, The code for this project isnt my finest work.
  Ive never been particulary worrid about creating clean code for manim.
  However, the interactive windows forum i created alongside this project does
  have more well though out code, and it can be run on any windows computer.
  I can recommend you check that out.
