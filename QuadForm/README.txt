QuadForm1 is a very simple slideshow-like demonstration.
It certainly isnt my best works, but it is one of my first

QuadForm2 is certainly much better. However, the part in which
i descibe completing the square, uses a rather unintuitive algebraic
demonstration. I decided to attempt a better geometric demonstration.
But i wanted to keep this version for myself

QuadForm3 is my final production.
